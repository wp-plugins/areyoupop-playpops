== Description ==

**Have you been struggling trying to grow your Facebook page audience?**

You post in your Facebook page periodically but can’t get more people to “Like” your page. If you are struggling with this task then you should use the power of YouTube videos in your blog to increase your Facebook audience.

Most people visit your website but won’t necessarily join your email list out of fear of being spammed. A safer and more personal way to stay in touch with your content is by liking your Facebook page. Unfortunately, most people don’t look for your Facebook icon in your website or feel compelled to become friends in Facebook just because you wrote a great blog post.

Now, with PlayPops for WordPress, you can ask them to like your page when they are visually engaged.

**Re-target your Promotions and Products**

Capture, re-target, promote and sell to your always growing audience and fans. This plugin shows a popup box in front of your already engaging YouTube video asking readers to join your Facebook page whenever they pause the video. Once the user has joined your Facebook Page then you can re-target them with promotions to your products or new blog posts or articles.

The perfect opportunity to make a “call to action” (ex. Like us Now) is when your users are iterating (play, pause) with your video. Show them social proof that others have joined.

**Take Advantage of Viral Effect**

Combine the virality power of YouTube with the power of Facebook to grow your audience with the help of Facebook’s 900 million plus users with this Youtube/Facebook traffic plugin. Social PlayPops© for WordPress is a ‘popup’ that allows you to acquire more users to your facebook page with the help of YouTube Videos.
